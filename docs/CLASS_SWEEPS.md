# Class sweeps — the register

A **screen walk** finds an instance. A **class sweep** finds every other place the
same mistake was made. Five device rounds (`npm run walk`, `docs/ANDROID_LAUNCH.md`
"Screen sweep") missed that every money figure was wrong for non-EUR members,
because the walk account is EUR — where the two formatters agree. One class sweep
found 60 sites in an afternoon.

This file is the register: which classes have been swept, what each found, what
landed, and what is still open. It exists because sweep results kept living only
in a chat session, so the open half was re-discovered instead of fixed.

## The method

1. **Real evidence first.** Walk as a real production account and check the screen
   against the production DB, not against the screen.
2. **Turn each finding into a CLASS** — the sentence form is "X, and nobody
   noticed because Y".
3. **Run the classes in parallel, read-only**, one agent per class, with a brief
   that demands `file:line` + the user-visible consequence, and that ends with
   *"list the false positives you discarded"*. An agent that reports no false
   positives usually did not look.
4. **Verify the agents — do not trust them.** Every sweep so far has contained at
   least one confident finding that did not survive reading the file. Two invented
   API paths were reported as 404s in the 09-16 run and retracted before they
   reached Merle; a fourth bare-date site the agent *missed* was found only by the
   gate written afterwards.
5. **Fix by class, not by instance**: one shared rule, then every call site, then a
   test.
6. **Prove the test** by re-breaking the defect. A guard that asserts the *shape*
   of a fix passes while the effect is broken.
7. **Gates → commit per batch → memory file.**

Two rules the tooling learned the hard way:

- **Resolve per block, not per file** — a marker at the top of a file silences
  every later site in it.
- **Strip comments before matching**, and **make allowlists fail when an entry
  goes stale**, or the allowlist outlives the reason for it.

## Register

| | Class | Swept | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | The client calls an endpoint the server does not serve (or that fails for a real member) | 2026-09-16 | 1 open (server-side) |
| B | A number on screen that its own source of truth disagrees with | 2026-09-16 | ✅ landed `02ee84b` |
| C | The screen shows nothing useful for many seconds although the data is fast | 2026-09-16 | ✅ landed `02ee84b` |
| D | One business rule, implemented twice, drifting | 2026-09-16 | ⚠️ report not retained — re-run |
| E | What the member typed is not what we stored | 2026-09-16 | ✅ closed — gate rule was wrong, 13 sites + validators fixed |
| F | The write succeeded and the screen still shows the old value | 2026-09-16 | 2 open |
| G | A paid feature a free member can reach, or a free feature a paying member is denied | 2026-09-16 | 4 decisions for Merle |
| H | The date on screen is not the date that was meant | 2026-09-16 | partly landed; locale half open |
| I | One tap, two writes (unguarded async handlers) | launched 09-16 | ⛔ agents died on a session rate limit — not run |
| J | A member can see data that is not theirs (RLS / IDOR / public views) | launched 09-16 | ⛔ not run |
| K | The save half-happened (multi-step writes without a transaction) | launched 09-16 | ⛔ not run |
| L | The control is there but a person cannot use it (touch targets, labels, contrast) | launched 09-16 | ⛔ not run |

I–L were launched as four parallel read-only agents on 2026-09-16 and all four
died within seconds of each other on the account's session limit. The briefs are
worth re-running verbatim; K got far enough to confirm one sharper variant of the
partial-write class before it died (see K below).

## What landed

All in `02ee84b` "Money: convert it, parse it, and total it from the right source",
on top of `b1f3828` (the `empty-on-failure` class).

- **B / currency** — 60 sites rendered a EUR amount with the member's currency
  symbol and no conversion. `fmtCurrency(amountEUR, settings)` converts;
  `formatPrice(amount, currency)` formats as given. A USD member read "$1.348" for
  €1.347,68; a JPY member was off by ~160×. Write side got
  `memberAmountToEUR(amount, settings)`. Gate: `scripts/check-currency-conversion.mjs`.
- **B / the Items tab total** — the header summed the *loaded pages* (20 at a time)
  under Home's label, so over 20 items the same fact read smaller on Items than on
  Home, and grew while scrolling. `src/lib/portfolioTotalLabel.ts`: the server total
  wins; otherwise the loaded sum, marked `+`.
- **C / first paint** — `AuthProvider` awaited the profile read before rendering,
  costing up to 6s on a cold start. Now `void loadProfile(...)`, with in-flight
  dedupe keyed on the entry (the first version stored the promise and compared the
  wrong object, so it never cleared), and a failed read no longer wipes the profile.
- **E / parsing** — `parseFloat` on a typed amount breaks on "12,50" and
  "1.250,00". `parseMoney` (last separator is the decimal point) at the 4 HIGH
  sites; a local shadow in `useItemDetail` removed. Gate
  `scripts/check-locale-number-parsing.mjs` was fixed — its regex was word-boundary
  anchored and matched no camelCase identifier at all, i.e. it had been passing
  vacuously — and `__tests__/lib/parseMoney.test.ts` was wired into `verify:prebuild`,
  which it was not (a test file is not a gate).
- **H / bare dates** — `new Date('2026-09-16')` is UTC midnight, so an event is
  "past" from 02:00 CEST on its own day. 4 sponsor sites + the week view now use
  `src/lib/calendar.ts`. Gate: `scripts/check-bare-date-parse.mjs`, which found the
  4th site the sweep had missed.

Three of those gates were mutation-proven (break the code → the gate goes red).

## What is open

Verified in the working tree on 2026-09-16; each line names the file so it can be
re-checked rather than re-believed.

**A — endpoints**
- `/collections/user/progress` returns 500 for a real member. Server-side fix,
  needs a deploy.

**F — stale cache** (`src/data/CachedDataProvider.ts`)
- `CATEGORY_SUMMARIES: 'categories:summaries'` (line 58) is not invalidated by item
  mutations, so adding or deleting an item leaves the category counts stale for
  the TTL.
- `profile:${userId}` (line 375) is never cleared after a profile edit, so a member
  can save a change and keep seeing the old value.

**H — the locale half** (dates are right now; their *formatting* is not)
- 9 sites hard-code `'en-US'` for a date a member reads:
  `src/components/PriceExplanationSheet.tsx:205`, `src/components/projects/ProjectCard.tsx:30`,
  `src/components/sponsor/AnnouncementsListSection.tsx:22`,
  `src/components/events/WeekViewCalendar.tsx:66` (×2), `app/inbox.tsx:56`,
  `app/chat/[threadId].tsx:116` and `:631`, `app/sponsor/dashboard.tsx:98`.
  A Dutch member reads "Sep 16" where the rest of the app says "16 sep".
  (The `'en-US'` values in `src/lib/format.ts` and `src/lib/settings.tsx` are the
  currency-locale table and are correct — do not sweep those.)
- 2 charts hard-code `"en-GB"`: `src/components/PriceTrendChart.tsx:51`,
  `src/components/PortfolioLineChart.tsx:62`.
- `src/app/(admin)/review.tsx:60` renders a bare `toLocaleString()` — device
  locale, not app locale. (`CategoryLeaderboardSection.tsx:105` has the same bug
  but sits behind `GAMIFICATION_UI_ENABLED`, which is off; its header documents it.)
- Server "today" is defined twice: Python computes it in CEST, Postgres in UTC.

**E — closed 2026-09-16 (second pass)**
The "~14 MED idiom sites" were not a MED backlog: the idiom is shape 5, wrong on
any amount with a thousands separator, and the gate was recommending it in its
own header. 13 sites fixed onto `parseMoney`, plus `parseMoney`'s own
lone-three-digit-group bug, plus `numeric()`/`positiveNumber()`, which rejected
"12,50" outright and so blocked listing, Add Item and mandates for comma-decimal
members. Full write-up: `docs/ui-playbook.md` "The gate taught the bug".

**Listings count** needs the `+` treatment the Items total got (it prints the
loaded count as if it were the total).

**Suites that are red and gate nothing** — `npx jest` runs 126 suites; **10 still
fail (12 tests)** and none of them is named in `verify:prebuild`. Remaining: four
snapshot suites, `ItemCard` a11y, `analytics`, `marketplace-extracted`,
`usePortfolioInsights`, `settings` (snapshots stale since May), and
`marketMoversTitle` (missing `react-native-purchases` mock). Triage each, then
either fix it or name it in the gate — an unnamed suite is not a gate
(`learning_a_test_file_is_not_a_gate`).

`__tests__/hooks/useItemDetail.test.ts` was the eleventh and is now green and
gated. Its 5 failures were **not** an app defect, and it took a captured stack to
know that rather than a reading: 4 tested `forSaleLoading` / `handleListForSale` /
`handleUnlist`, deleted with the toggle-for-sale chain in `dabfc32` and never
removed from the suite; the 5th omitted `initialPurchasePrice`, which the hook
requires, so `editablePurchasePrice` was `undefined` and `.trim()` threw. The
screen always passes `''`, so the app was never exposed.

**I — one confirmed instance** (the class was never swept; the agent died first)
- `app/purchase/deal/[dealId].tsx:120` `handleDecline` has no in-flight guard and
  its control no `disabled`, while its sibling `handleConfirm` uses `setConfirming`.
  The server's decline is `UPDATE … WHERE status = ANY(_DECLINABLE_STATUSES)`
  (`server/app/agents/purchase_router.py:818`), so the second tap updates 0 rows
  and returns 404 — the member sees "Failed to dismiss" on a deal that was
  dismissed. Discarded as guarded while checking this: `favorites.onUnsave`
  (optimistic removal takes the row away), `users/[userId].handleBlockToggle`
  (closes the menu, then confirms through an Alert), `OfferAmountSheet.handleSubmit`
  (`busy` guard), the three `AppearanceSection` setters (idempotent settings writes).

**K — one instance confirmed and FIXED 2026-09-17** (the class itself is still
unswept: the agent died before enumerating)
- `useItemDetail.onSaveEdits` writes name/category, then a PostgREST patch, then
  the purchase row — and the cost-basis parse threw *after* the first two landed,
  so an unreadable price saved the name and then said "Failed to save changes",
  with no way to tell which half happened. Every amount is now read BEFORE the
  first write, and the toast names the field instead of the whole save.
  Mutation-proven: restoring the old order turns the new test red. What this
  cannot fix is a network failure between two writes — that needs the server to
  take both in one transaction, which is the rest of class K.

## Decisions for Merle (class G)

Not bugs with an obvious fix — each is a product call.

1. **Pro analytics endpoints are open to free accounts.** Either gate them or stop
   calling them Pro.
2. **`max_daily_deal_alerts` is enforced nowhere.** It is declared in
   `server/app/routes/billing_router.py:170/183/213` and the e2e file
   `server/tests/e2e/e2e_plan_caps.py` asserts the *worker* reads it — check that
   assertion still holds, because the cap does not appear on the serving path.
3. **Sell-timing requires `premium`** (`server/app/features/sell_timing_router.py:53`,
   ranks in `server/app/subscription.py:29` are free 0 / pro 1 / premium 2). The
   client maps a `premium` entitlement (`src/lib/purchases.ts:24`), but per project
   memory only **Free and Pro** are configured in RevenueCat — so no in-app
   subscriber can reach it; only a web Stripe premium price can. Verify in the
   RevenueCat dashboard, then either publish a premium product or lower the gate.
4. **The `internal` EAS profile ships with `EXPO_PUBLIC_BETA_UNLOCK_ALL=true`**
   (`eas.json:75`), which reports every user as `pro` and skips RevenueCat
   entirely. It is deliberate and documented, and `store`/`apk` pin it `false` —
   but `submit.production` points at the same `ascAppId` as `store`, so an
   `eas submit -p production` on the wrong artefact would ship a paywall-less
   build. Worth a submit-time assertion rather than a comment.

## Re-running a sweep

Give the agent: the class in one sentence, a **worked instance** from this repo,
the scope (and what is out of scope), "verify both ends before reporting",
"`file:line` + the user-visible consequence", "rank by money > privacy > social >
cosmetic", and "list the false positives you discarded and why". Read-only, no
edits, no prod writes.

Then write the gate before the fix, and prove the gate fails.
